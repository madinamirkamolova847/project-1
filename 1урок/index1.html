            John Smith, a construction executive, and his wife Jane, a tech support consultant, are at marriage counseling. 
            They have been married for five or six years, and their marriage is suffering from a lack of communication and acts of 
            quiet aggression, such as Jane installing drapes that John said he disliked. They first met in Bogotá, Colombia, claiming 
            to be together to avoid being questioned by Colombian authorities. 
            The two had a whirlwind courtship and married.
